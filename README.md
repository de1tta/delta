## ❓ FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

**Q1: Is Delta Executor safe to use on my primary Apple device?**  
Yes, **delta executor for ios** uses advanced sandboxing and doesn't require jailbreaking. However, as with any script executor, using it on alternate accounts first is recommended to understand functionality before risking your main account.

**Q2: How does the direct install work without jailbreak?**  
The **delta executor direct install ipa** method utilizes enterprise certificates and developer provisioning profiles that allow installation outside the App Store. This is completely legal and doesn't modify your iOS system files.
